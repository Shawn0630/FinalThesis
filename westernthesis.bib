abstract="An ordered labeled tree is a tree in which the nodes are labeled and the left-to-right order among siblings is relevant. The edit distance between two ordered labeled trees is the minimum cost of transforming one tree into the other through a sequence of edit operations. We present techniques for speeding up the tree edit distance computation which are applicable to a family of algorithms based on closely related recursion strategies. These techniques aim to reduce repetitious steps in the original algorithms by exploring certain structural features in the tree. When these features exist in a large portion of the tree, the speedup due to our techniques would be significant. Viable examples for application include RNA secondary structure comparison and structured text comparison.",

abstract="An ordered labelled tree is a tree where the left-to-right order among siblings is significant. Ordered labelled forests are sequences of ordered labelled trees. Given two ordered labelled forests F and G, the local forest similarity is to find two sub-forests F{\textasciiacutex} and G{\textasciiacutex} of F and G respectively such that they are the most similar over all possible F{\textasciiacutex} and G{\textasciiacutex}. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for the local forest similarity problem for two types of sub-forests: sibling subforests and closed subforests. Our algorithms can be used to locate the structurally similar regions in RNA secondary structures since RNA molecules' secondary structures could be represented as ordered labelled forests.",
